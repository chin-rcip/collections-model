## Actor Appellation

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field designates the entire identifying word(s), number(s), symbol(s) or code(s) by which an entity (personal or corporate) is distinguished from others, such as the name, title, or designation of an actor as it has been attributed by a contributing institution. It is an identifying agreed upon term that is descriptive or connotative. If it is made of the concatenation of numerous parts, it should include all of them (such as honorifics, titles, etc.).|

|**Typical Case(s)**|*Kitwancool*was painted by Emily Carr in 1928. In this case a provider could decide enter “Emily Carr” in the Actor Appellation field. It would also be possible to use the Actor Appellation Part fields to create an “Emily” Actor Appellation Part (“First Name” in the Actor Appellation Part Type) and a “Carr” Actor Appellation Part (“Last Name” in the Actor Appellation Part Type).<br><br>However, such Appellations should be indicated as Non-Preferred under Actor Appellation Precedence so that original names have precedence. This would especially be the case for Indigenous creators who might have been assigned a name or number by Canadian governing bodies in lieu of their own name. In such cases CHIN advises institutions to always prefer the Appellation preferred by the Actor.<br><br>Power Corporation of Canada, headquartered in Montréal, has an important private collection of artworks. Another Actor Appellation could be created for “Power Corp” that is a brand name (under Actor Appellation Type) of Power Corporation of Canada. Its International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is “CA7392391016” and it is traded as “TSX: POW”, both of which could have their dedicated Actor Appellations as well (with their respective Actor Appellation Type being “International Securities Identification Number” and “Stock Symbol”.|
|**Edge Case(s)**|If a war artist was assigned the number “M32 435 C84” (his military registration number), this number would qualify as an Actor Appellation and the Actor Appellation Type would be “Military Registration Number” or “Military ID”. If the War Museum is related to the Department of National Defence or uses these numbers to identify artists, this number would qualify both as an Actor Appellation (the number assigned by the Department of Defence) and as an Actor ID (the same number used by the War Museum).<br><br>The French appellation of the “Power Corporation of Canada” is “Power Corporation du Canada”. An institution wanting to record both these appellations could either create two Actor Appellations (one for Power Corporation of Canada indicated as English in the Actor Appellation Field, and one for Power Corporation du Canada indicated as French in the Actor Appellation Language field) or a single, bilingual one (Power Corporation of Canada/Power Corporation du Canada).<br><br>The same applies to many governmental bodies in Canada such as PCH Canadian Heritage/Patrimoine Canadien where, in addition, the question of the language of the acronym is unclear: if “PCH” is an Actor Appellation with a Actor Appellation Type “Acronym”, it is impossible to assign a single language to the Actor Appellation Language.<br><br>Unknown artists whose cultural affiliation has been determined are often referred to as such (e.g. “Unknown Canadian”)... how and where unknown artists should be recorded is subject to debate (considering “unknown Canadian” is not an Actor Appellation and the cultural affiliation of the individual can be recorded in the Cultural Affiliation field).<br><br>Whether to classify (artistic, but also other, such as companies) collectives (e.g. Gilbert & George, BGL, etc.) as an organization (using an Actor Appellation) or a group (using a Group Appellation) has not yet been determined. Provided the collective considers itself to be an autonomous artistic entity, it would not suit a Group Appellation considering Group belonging revolves around the multiplicity of entities. The same would apply for trios, etc. (e.g. BGL) as long as the “group” considers itself to be a single autonomous creator. For example, should BGL be recorded under Actor Appellation with the Actor Appellation Type “Acronym” and “Brand Name” (which begs the question: do we allow more than one type on a single Actor Appellation) or under Group Appellation with the members being recorded as Actors with the Actor Appellations “Jasmin Bilodeau”, “Sébastien Giguère”, and “Nicolas Laverdière”?<br><br>Some institutions need to document animals as actors and although the current definition could accommodate this, CIDOC CRM might not. For example, Wojtek was a bear officially enlisted in the Polish army.|

## Actor Appellation Language

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field indicates the natural or technical language the Actor Appellation is written in. This is a qualifying field so that it necessarily relates to an Actor Appellation and there cannot be an Actor Appellation Language without an Actor Appellation.|
|**Generated Bond(s)**|E56\_Language|

In the event that the value is adequately structured but does not reconcile with any terms from the controlled vocabulary, and provided that it is deemed relevant, CHIN will add the term to the vocabulary.<br>Accepted Value Type(s): String<br><br>*High*: The provided value is a string that can be automatically reconciled with the controlled vocabularies specified by CHIN.<br>Accepted Value Type(s): String, URI|
|**Typical Case(s)**|Some languages have alphabets that are specific (e.g. Inuktitut) so that determining the Language of the Appellation would not be problematic, for example: “ᕿᓐᓄᐊᔪᐊᖅᐋᓯᕙᒃ” is written in Inuktitut. That said, this does not account for dialects nor for the fact that identifying what alphabet an Actor Appellation is written in might be problematic. This begs the question of whether there should be a field dedicated to character sets/alphabets (e.g. latin, arabic, chinese, etc.).<br><br>Other cases are language-specific versions of a name, such as the Actor Appellation “Léonard de Vinci”, which would have and Actor Appellation Language value of “French”. “Leonardo da Vinci” on the other hand would be harder to classify as it has no intrinsic language, it is simply the name of the Actor (this is demonstrated by the fact that the same Actor Appellation is used both in English and in Italian). The same would apply to groups (e.g. “Aldo” is not specifically French or English, but “Second Cup Café et cie.” is the French equivalent to “Second Cup Coffee Co.”).|
|**Edge Case(s)**|The original appellation of a person is not fundamentally linked to a language (Leonardo da Vinci is “Leonardo da Vinci” both in English and in Italian, although in French he is referred to as “Léonard de Vinci”).<br><br>Any Actor Appellation that is a number would not fit nicely into a languages controlled vocabulary either. For example, “0100101110101101.ORG”, a collective comprising Eva and Franco Mattes.<br><br>Bilingual considerations apply to many governmental bodies in Canada such as PCH Canadian Heritage/Patrimoine Canadien where, in addition, the question of the language of the acronym is unclear: if “PCH” is an Actor Appellation with a Actor Appellation Type “Acronym”, it is impossible to assign a single language to the Actor Appellation Language. As such, would the Actor Appellation Language accomodate a list of languages as values? The Appellations could also be divided into Actor Appellation Parts with “PCH” having and Actor Appellation Part Type “Affix”, “Canadian Heritage” having an Appellation Part Type “Root” and “Patrimoine canadien” having an Appellation Part Type “Root” as well. This begs the question of the order and manner in which Actor Appellation Parts will be displayed.|

|**Controlled List/Term**|TBD|
|**Potential Error(s)**|TBD|
|**Comment(s)**|Internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminologies (such as ISO 639-3) can be used, and the field accommodates all UTF-8 compliant languages.<br><br>The language of the Actor Appellation can differ from that of the Actor Appellation Language (for example, the Actor Appellation can be “ᐃᓱᒪ”, yet the Actor Appellation Language can be “Inuktitut” rather than “ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ”).<br><br>Regarding the “Expected Value” link, [Lexvo](http://www.lexvo.org/) does not have any browse or search capability for identifying languages, i.e. you can keysmash into Lexvo and it will generate a URI for "hsdjkhsdhf" without verifying whether this is a recognized language or not. In order to find language URIs on Lexvo (as opposed to terms in a language), the search has to be done using ISO-639 codes and the [ISO-639 Code Tables](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data) do not allow browsing, only free searching, and do not cross-reference to geographic region. So the effort involved in verifying whether languages provided in the [First Nations, Metis and Inuit Indigenous Ontologies (FNMIIO) spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSOKcm9HB-28iSqNN3sQd5hV7bMLMGpCeGL0dkQgyg2AiZAMWUF0sp98GyxIvLXYIWqSZ3nX_j_q4UN/pubhtml) are recognized as languages with URIs or have ISO codes is considerable at this stage given that 99.9% of museum data is in English or French. This is something CHIN intends to come back to once datasets for all other fields have been completed or if an operational need arises.<br><br>CHIN has decided to expand the definition of the field to accommodate both natural and technical languages because allowing only natural languages would not bring about more meaning. Allowing both accounts for potential names that might use technical languages (for example, an artist that would use @ID as their name). This is mostly to be more mindful of potential edge cases.|

|**Edge Case(s)**|Middle names in general are hard to situate within an Actor Appellation. For example, Jean Paul Riopelle could be considered to be “Jean” (Actor Appellation Part Type “First Name”), “Paul” (Actor Appellation Part Type “Middle Name”) and “Riopelle” (Actor Appellation Part Type “Last Name”) just as it could be “Jean Paul” (Actor Appellation Part Type “First Name”) “Riopelle” (Actor Appellation Part Type “Last Name”). How to determine the order and display of parts will thus be a challenge.<br><br>The same applies to organizations’ appellations that might have multiple parts such as “Randy & Berenicci”, which would be composed of three Actor Appellation Parts (“Randy”, Actor Appellation Part Type “Root”; “&”, Actor Appellation Part Type “Affix”; “Berenicci”, Actor Appellation Part Type “Root”). In this case how to determine the order of the Actor Appellation Parts could not be automatized and would likely be problematic. In addition, whether to classify an artistic duo (or trio etc.) as an organization (using an Actor Appellation) or a group (using a Group Appellation) has not yet been determined. Provided the duo considers itself to be an autonomous artistic entity, it would not suit a Group Appellation considering Group belonging revolves around the multiplicity of entities.|

## Actor Appellation Precedence

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field indicates if the institution contributing the data considers the related Actor Appellation to have precedence over other, alternative Actor Appellations.|

|**Typical Case(s)**|A provider might have several artefacts from a single creator and different Actor Appellations for said creator. For example, the Tate might indicate in its records that *A View from an Apartment* (2004-2005) is by Jeff Wall (Actor Appellation “Jeff Wall”) and *Diagonal Composition* (1993) is by Jeffrey Wall (Actor Appellation “Jeffrey Wall”), thus creating two Actor Appellations for a single artist. In this case, a preferred Actor Appellation should be specified (e.g. “Actor Appellation Precedence” should be indicated as Preferred for “Jeff Wall” so that “Jeffrey Wall” will automatically be non-preferred).|
|**Edge Case(s)**|A provider might have more than two Actor Appellations for a single `E39_Actor` and might wish not only to identify its preferred appellation, but to rank them. For example, “Actor Appellation Precedence” indicated as 1 (preferred) for “Jeff Wall”, as 2 (non-preferred to 1 but preferred to 3) for “Jeffrey Wall”, and as 3 (non-preferred) for “J. Wall”. At the moment the model accommodates binary precedence rather than rankings. This might especially be so for organizational names that are bilingual where no precedence should be determined based on the Language. For example, the “National Gallery of Canada” and “Musée des beaux-arts du Canada” would likely not want to ascribe a precedence to either of its appellations, but it might want to ascribe precedence to both of these Appellations over “NGC” or “National Gallery” or “MBAC” or “Musée des beaux-arts”. Only two Appellations (one in English and one in French, in this case) is no problem as no precedence will be ascribed. But any more than two Appellations poses the problem of precedence. In addition, this does not indicate how the data should, ultimately, be displayed (e.g. English before French or vice-versa).|

This begs the question of whether there can be more than one Actor Appellation Type for a single Actor Appellation (e.g. “Exonym” and “Name”) and how the providing institution represents this when contributing its data.|

For example, Anne of Green Gables’ birth name would be Anne Shirley, and she became Anne Blythe by marrying Gilbert Blythe. A museum might enter Anne Shirley as her Actor Appellation, and another might consider Anne Shirley Blythe as her Actor Appellation, with Anne being the first name, Shirley being the maiden name, and Blythe being the married name. Once again, the institution’s authority will be respected here.<br><br>For marginalized communities where individuals have often been ascribed names that they do not consider their own it seems preferable to link the `E39_Actor` to the name use activity (`frbroo:F52_Name_Use_Activity`) to indicate that the name is imposed on the person. Some imposed names could be accounted for here (such as when the Actor Appellation is a slave name for example), but there is no way to account for the correct name, nor to give precedence to the person’s preferred name (because CHIN is non-authoritative). For example, “Malcolm Little” could be typified as a slave name, and “Malcolm X” as a given name.|

|**Typical Case(s)**|Wangechi Mutu’s Wikipedia entry goes as follows: “Wangechi Mutu (Kenyan-American, born 1972) is a prominent international contemporary visual artist known primarily for her painting, sculpture, film and performance work. Born in Kenya, she has lived and established her career in New York for over twenty years. Mutu's work has directed the female body as subject through collage painting, immersive installation, and live and video performance all the while exploring questions of self-image, gender constructs, cultural trauma and environmental destruction”.|
|**Edge Case(s)**|A Group’s Biography could be categorized either as a Curatorial Note Content or as a Biography Content. For example, Snarkitecture’s Wikipedia entry goes as follows: “Snarkitecture is a New York-based collaborative practice founded by Daniel Arsham and Alex Mustonen. Snarkitecture's work is focused on designing within existing spaces or collaboration with other artists and designers. They aim to reuse or misuse existing architecture to make architecture perform the unexpected. Arsham and Mustonen met while studying at the Cooper Union in New York City and established Snarkitecture as a formal practice in 2008”.<br><br>Relying on textual biographies will likely be a problem when it comes to the documentation of actors coming from cultures oriented towards orality of intangible heritage.|

|**Edge Case(s)**|Some languages have alphabets that are specific (e.g. Inuktitut) so that determining the Language of the Appellation would not be problematic, for example: “ᕿᓐᓄᐊᔪᐊᖅᐋᓯᕙᒃ” is written in Inuktitut. That said, this does not account for dialects nor for the fact that identifying what alphabet an Actor Appellation is written in might be problematic. This begs the question of whether we should have a field dedicated to character sets/alphabets (e.g. latin, arabic, chinese, etc.).<br><br>Bilingual considerations could apply to Biographies as well so that it would either be impossible to assign a single Biography Language to the Biography Content, or the field would have to accomodate a list of values. For example, Harri Aalto’s Biography could be recorded as either Harri Aalto (Actor Appellation) “immigrated to Canada in 1952” (Biography Content with an “English” Biography Language) along with “a immigré au Canada en 1952” (Biography Content with a “French” Biography Language) or as “Harri Aalto immigrated to Canada in 1952 / Harri Aalto a immigré au Canada en 1952” (Biography Content with no way to record both languages in the Biography Language).|

|**Edge Case(s)**|Community and Cultural Affiliation Type are two fields that are extremely similar and it is highly likely that they will be confused as most people who are part of a community identify as part of that community (cultural affiliation type). Nonetheless, having both fields appears to be useful to differentiate between the community people are perceived to be part of (Community), and that which they identify with. One of the types of information CHIN has not yet determined where to assign is smaller bodies such as provinces that could be recorded in Community or Cultural Affiliation Type. Other identity affiliation might also be difficult to categorize. For example, Armand Vaillancourt identified as a “souverainiste”, which could also fit (although this is debatable) the scope of Cultural Affiliation Type.|

This belonging is not official in the sense that assent from the concerned group is not formalized or explicit.|

|**Edge Case(s)**|Community and Cultural Affiliation Type are two fields that are extremely similar and it is highly likely that they will be confused as most people who are part of a community identify as part of that community (cultural affiliation). Nonetheless, having both fields appears to be useful to differentiate between the community people are perceived to be part of (Community) from which they identify with. One of the types of information CHIN has not yet determined where to assign is smaller bodies such as provinces that could be recorded in Community or Cultural Affiliation Type. Other identity affiliation might also be difficult to categorize. For example, Armand Vaillancourt identified as a “souverainiste”, which could fit (although this is debatable) the scope of Cultural Affiliation Type.<br><br>Some Actors might identify themselves as “Cosmopolitan” first and foremost, and in such a case it would be recorded here.<br><br>Polities or other groups might identify as being culturally affiliated to larger groups, such as France with regards to Europe.|

|**Scope**|This field designates the entire identifying word(s), number(s), symbol(s) or code(s) by which a group’s main agent in charge of or responsible for the group’s dissolution is distinguished from others, such as the name, title, or designation as it has been attributed by a contributing institution. Their appellation is an identifying agreed upon term that is descriptive or connotative. If it is made of the concatenation of numerous parts, it should include all of them (such as honorifics, titles, etc.).|

|**Typical Case(s)**|“James M. Morgan” (Dissolving Actor Appellation) was the CEO of Atari (Group Appellation) from 1983 until its dissolution in July 1984 (Death/Dissolution Date Begin).<br><br>Painters Eleven was a Torontonian artists group that emerged in the 1950s and was composed of Jack Bush, Oscar Cahén, Hortense Gordon, Thomas Hodgson, Alexandra Luke, J.W.G. ("Jock") Macdonald, Ray Mead, Kazuo Nakamura, William Ronald, Harold Town, and Walter Yarwood. Following the death of Cahén, the move of Mead to Montréal and the resignation of Ronald, the nine remaining artists decided to disband (Jack Bush, Dissolving Actor Appellation; Hortense Gordon, Dissolving Actor Appellation; Thomas Hodgson, Dissolving Actor Appellation; Alexandra Luke, Dissolving Actor Appellation; J.W.G. ("Jock") Macdonald, Dissolving Actor Appellation; Kazuo Nakamura, Dissolving Actor Appellation; Harold Townand, Dissolving Actor Appellation; Walter Yarwood, Dissolving Actor Appellation).|
|**Edge Case(s)**|CIDOC CRM’s scope note indicates that it pertains to the dissolution of a Group. However, at the moment, companies can be classified as an Actor or a Group. For example, “James M. Morgan” (Dissolving Actor Appellation) was the CEO of Atari (Group/Actor Appellation) from 1983 until its dissolution in July 1984 (Death/Dissolution Date Begin).|

## Gender Type

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field documents the cultural gender (not the biological one) that a person identifies as. As a socio-cultural concept it refers to a state or condition associated with a range of characteristics having to do with a person’s behaviour, mannerisms, interests, and appearance, and the way they are associated with gendered categories in a particular cultural context.|

## Group Appellation

("Jock") Macdonald, Ray Mead, Kazuo Nakamura, William Ronald, Harold Town, and Walter Yarwood.|
|**Edge Case(s)**|Whether to classify artistic collectives (e.g. Gilbert & George, BGL, etc.) as an organization (using an Actor Appellation) or a group (using a Group Appellation) has not yet been determined. Provided the collective considers itself to be an autonomous artistic entity, it would not suit a Group Appellation considering Group belonging revolves around the multiplicity of entities. The same would apply for trios, etc. (e.g. BGL) as long as the “group” considers itself to be a single autonomous creator. For example, should BGL be recorded under Actor Appellation with the Actor Appellation Types “Acronym” and “Brand Name” (which begs the question: do we allow more than one type on a single Actor Appellation) or under Group Appellation with the members being recorded as Actors with the Actor Appellations “Jasmin Bilodeau”, “Sébastien Giguère”, and “Nicolas Laverdière”? Pseudonyms might also be used to refer to groups/duos, such as in the cas of “0100101110101101.ORG”, a collective constituted of Eva and Franco Mattes.<br><br>Certain groups are comprised of members that are entirely anonymous. Should such groups be recorded under Actor Appellation (or will CHIN convert them accordingly?). For example, the Guerilla Girls are an art collective whose members are shifting and wish to remain entirely anonymous.|

For example, the Governor General's Literary Awards were conceived and inaugurated in 1937 (Group Joining Date Begin) by John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir who was then acting as 15th Governor General of Canada. He awarded the award for fiction to Laura G. Salverson for *The Dark Weaver*(Group Member Role “Member” or “Recipient”), that for Poetry of drama to E.J. Pratt for *The Fable of the Goats*(Group Member Role “Member” or “Recipient”), and the award for Non-fiction to Stephen Leacock for *My Discovery of the West*(Group Member Role “Member” or “Recipient”)*.* Considering the Group would be the “Recipients of the Governor General of Canada Literary Awards”, would the original recipients considered to be founders (Group Member Role) or would the founder of the award itself (John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir) be considered to be the founder of the group as well?|

It is also debatable whether this is Mark Type for Surrey NanoSystems as well. This also poses the question of whether, if a mark is mainly used to enforce identity, it must enforce the identity of the main Actor, or if it can enforce that of a third party (e.g. even though *Cloud Gate* is by Kapoor, this could be considered to enforce Surrey NanoSystems’ identity just as much).<br><br>What constitutes a mark might also be complicated by what it is posed on. Would the mark have to be permanent? Would a tattoo constitute a Mark for example? Or a sunburn such as in Dennis Oppenheim’s *Reading Position for Second Degree Burn* performance showing two parallel before and after images of a man sunbathing on the sand.

## Mother Appellation

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field designates the entire identifying word(s), number(s), symbol(s) or code(s) by which an actor’s biological mother is distinguished from others, such as the name, title, or designation as it has been attributed by a contributing institution. Her appellation is an identifying agreed upon term that is descriptive or connotative. If it is made of the concatenation of numerous parts, it should include all of them (such as honorifics, titles, etc.).|

## Nationality

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field indicates the status of belonging (by origin, birth, or naturalization) to a politically autonomous entity endowed with national independence. Unlike cultural affiliation type, which relies on self-association with a culture, nationality refers to the legal status of being a citizen or a subject of a recognized state. \*|

It refers to the nation the actor identifies/is identified with regardless of their nationality or culture.|

|**Edge Case(s)**|How to distinguish works that are titled *Untitled* from those that are not titled might be problematic when ingesting the data. Conversely, it would be difficult to distinguish an object for which there is no title from an object for which we do not have the title.<br><br>Marie-Guillemine Benoist’s *Portrait of Madeleine* was formerly titled using a racial description. Only recent scholarship has established the sitter’s name as “Madeleine”, although her last name remains unknown. An Annotation could be placed on its Object Appellations (with “Portrait of Madeleine” as the preferred appellation, “Former title displaying insensitive racial language” Annotation; the former title as a non-preferred appellation, “Now titled Portrait of Madeleine” Annotation; “Portrait d’une femme noire”, non-preferred appellation, “Former title displaying insensitive racial language” Annotation), but a Curatorial Note Content might also be used on the Actor Appellation “Madeleine” (“Sitter in *Portrait of Madeleine,* former title displaying insensitive racial language with the sitter identified as being named “Madeleine” by Viktoria Schmidt-Linsenhoff"). There are a number of works in collections in Canada that have offensive or otherwise insensitive titles fraught with racist and colonialist terminology. Handling such appellations, and their of precedence, will have to be determined by CHIN. Should such titles be displayed? Should they be non-preferred? Should there be an Object Appellation Type to signal revision (e.g. Revised Titled) with a prompt to generate a note as to why the title was revised?|

## Object Appellation Precedence

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field indicates if the institution contributing the data considers the related Object Appellation to have precedence over other, alternative Object Appellations. This is a qualifying field that is used to assess priority and distinguish preferred terms from non-preferred terms so that it necessarily relates to an Object Appellation and there cannot be a Preference of the Object Appellation without an Object Appellation.|

|**Edge Case(s)**|At the moment it is unclear how groups can be represented when it comes to relationships. The Relationship field should not be used to indicate an individual’s belonging to a group, but it can be used to record groups’ relationships to one another, including corporations. So for example, these fields would not be used to record Tom Thomson being part of the Group of Seven, but it would be used to record the Canadian War Artists Selection Committee (Group Appellation) is related to the Canadian War Records (Group Appellation), Canada’s Second World War art program.

|**Scope**|This field indicates the parts, activities, functions, and duties endorsed by the Related Actor with regards to the main Actor with which they have dealings ranging in duration from brief to enduring. These reflect a set of connected behaviours, rights, obligations, beliefs and norms expected from both parties and reflected in the contacts between them as well as the way they behave towards each other.|

However, this points to Actor relationships, and groups *can be actors*per current definitions.|

|**Scope**|This field indicates the relative rank and possible honour or prestige an actor holds relative to how well they are perceived to match society’s goals and ideals, as well as their associated hierarchical position in the group’s social stratification. Status reflects a set of connected behaviours, activities, functions, rights, obligations, duties, beliefs, lifestyle, and norms. It relies on the interactions between said actor and a community whose conference of the status upon the actor is a determining factor in the latter having tasks, rights, and beliefs associated with said status.|

|**Edge Case(s)**|Alice Ann Munro (Actor Appellation) is a Canadian short story writer and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature (Social Status Type “Nobel Laureate”), which she was awarded in Stockholm in 2013 (Social Status Place “Stockholm”; Social Status Date Begin “2013-10-10”). Munro died in 2013 shortly after having received the award (Social Status Date End “2013-10-10”; Social Status Date End Qualifier “after).

|**Comment(s)**|Defining a social status type requires identifying the generalizable characteristics and symbols applicable to all who are said to have that status. These characteristics must be contingent, relational, and dynamic in the sense that what they entail might change over time, but they must nonetheless remain salient.<br><br>A single actor can carry multiple different statuses at one time, just like they can carry a single status multiples times simultaneously. An actor’s status tends to vary with social context: in certain societies, lineage is the main determinant of status whilst in others professional occupations are more predominant.|

|**Typical Case(s)**|Molly Bobak (Actor Appellation) was a Canadian artist (Occupation Type) who served as Second Lieutenant (Occupation Type) during World War II from November 1942 when she enlisted in the Canadian Women’s Army Corps to September 1945. She went to London, GB (Stay Place) after Victory in Europe Day and met her future husband there, Brunislaw Jacob Bobak (Stay Date Begin “1945-05-08”; Stay Date Begin Qualifier “after”; Stay Date End “1945-09”; Stay Date End Qualifier “during”).|
|**Edge Case(s)**|There might be cases where the Stay Date End and the Stay Date End Qualifier would be the same, in particular when it comes to eras. For example, “Victorian Era” can be both the Stay Date End and the Stay Date End Qualifier. Determining what eras the qualifiers will entail (through the vocabulary used to handle them) will thus be paramount.<br><br>Some important dates in history have alternative names that could be considered to be either alternate appellations or qualifiers, such as 9/11, Victory in Europe Day, D-Day, etc.|

|**Comment(s)**|There can be more than one qualifier at once for a single Stay Date End (e.g. “BCE” and “BC”, which is the same information, the former being qualified using the non-christian acronym for “Before Common Era” and the latter using the christian “Before Christ”).|

|**Typical Case(s)**|*Flightstop* (Object Appellation; Object Appellation Language “English”; Object Appellation Type “Title”; Object Appellation Preference “Preferred”) is a sculpture (Object Medium and Technique Used) by artist (Occupation Type) Michael Snow (Actor Appellation), sometimes titled *Flight Stop*(Object Appellation; Object Appellation Language “English”; Object Appellation Type “Title”; Object Appellation Preference “Non-Preferred”). It has been displayed at the Toronto Eaton Centre (Object Record Contributor Appellation) since 1979 (Object Record Date Begin) when it was made and installed.|

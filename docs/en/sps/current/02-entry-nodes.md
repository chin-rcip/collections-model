## Actor Appellation

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field designates the entire identifying word·s, number·s, symbol·s, or code·s by which an actor (person or group) is distinguished from others, such as the name, title, or designation as it has been attributed by a contributing institution. It is an identifying agreed upon term that is descriptive or connotative. If it is made of the concatenation of numerous parts, it should include all of them (such as honorifics, titles, etc.).|

|**Typical Case·s**|In Artists in Canada, the identifier (Actor ID Type) of Yousuf Karsh (Actor Appellation) is 8494 (Actor ID). Yousuf Karsh is the English spelling (Actor Appellation Language) of the Armenian-Canadian photographer’s full name (Actor Appellation Type), whereas Յուսուֆ Քարշ (Actor Appellation) is the Armenian spelling (Actor Appellation Language). Yousuf Karsh is his preferred name (Actor Appellation Precedence) by the National Gallery of Canada. Yousuf (Actor Appellation Part) is his first name (Actor Appellation Part Type) and Karsh (Actor Appellation Part) is his surname (Actor Appellation Part Type). Karsh used his full name all his professional life (Actor Appellation Use Context), which spans from 1932 (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin Qualifier) to 1992 (Actor Appellation Use Date End) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date End Qualifier) (Canadian Heritage, Government of Canada 2011).<br><br>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson wrote *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* under his pen name Lewis Carroll while continuing to publish work as a mathematician under his birth name. He would thus have two actor appellations: Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Actor Appellation Type "Birth Name", Actor Appellation Use Context "Customary Name") and Lewis Carroll (Actor Appellation Type "Pen Name", Actor Appellation Use Context "Children’s Book Writing"). He published under his pen name Lewis Carroll for the first time in March 1856 (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin Qualifier) when his poem *Solitude* appeared in *The Train*, and for the last time in February 1898 (Actor Appellation Use Date End) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date End Qualifier) when his book *Three Sunsets and Other Poems* was published (Wikipedia 2022a).<br><br>*Kitwancool* was painted by Emily Carr (Actor Appellation); Emily (Actor Appellation Part) is her first name (Actor Appellation Part Type) and Carr (Actor Appellation Part) is her last name (Actor Appellation Part Type).<br><br>Power Corporation of Canada, headquartered in Montreal, has an important private collection of artworks and could be considered to bear several actor appellations such as its brand name (Actor Appellation Type) Power Corp (Actor Appellation) or its legal name (Actor Appellation Type) Power Corporation of Canada (Actor Appellation). Its International Securities Identification Number is CA7392391016 (Actor ID; Actor ID Type "ISIN") and it is traded as TSX: POW, which could have its dedicated actor appellations as well (Actor Appellation Type "Stock Symbol") (Wikipedia 2022b; Wikimedia 2022).<br><br>Tate (Actor Appellation) is the name used by (Actor Appellation Type "Corporate Name") the Tate institution which has other distinctive actor appellations for each of its branches (Actor Appellation "Tate", "Tate Britain", "Tate Modern", "Tate Modern 1", "Tate Modern 2", "Tate St Ives", and "Tate Liverpool"; Actor Appellation Type "Brand Name") (Tate 2022).|
|**Edge Case·s**|If a war artist was assigned the number M32 435 C84 (his military registration number), this number would qualify as the Actor Appellation and the Actor Appellation Type would be Military Registration Number or Military ID. If the War Museum is related to the Department of National Defence or uses the same numbers to identify artists, this number would qualify both as the Actor Appellation (the number assigned by the Department of Defence) and as the Actor ID (the same number used by the War Museum).<br><br>The French appellation of Power Corporation of Canada is Power Corporation du Canada. An institution wanting to record both these appellations could either create two Actor Appellations (one for Power Corporation of Canada indicated as English in the Actor Appellation Language node, and one for Power Corporation du Canada indicated as French in the Actor Appellation Language node) or a single, bilingual one (Power Corporation of Canada/Power Corporation du Canada).<br><br>The same applies to many governmental bodies in Canada such as PCH Canadian Heritage/Patrimoine canadien where, in addition, the question of the language of the acronym is unclear: if PCH is the Actor Appellation with the Actor Appellation Type "Acronym", it is possible to consider this as a single, bilingual appellation.<br><br>Some institutions need to document animals as actors and although the current definition could accommodate this, the CIDOC CRM model might not. For example, Wojtek was a bear officially enlisted in the Polish army (Wikipedia 2022c).|

|**Comment·s**|For appellations that are composed of parts (such as last names, first names, etc.), CHIN recommends the use of the Actor Appellation Part and Actor Appellation Part Type nodes in addition to the Actor Appellation node to document the appellation’s structure.<br><br>In some cases, unknown artists are referred to with the appellation "Unknown" or other particular identities (gender, nationality, etc.). However, the Actor Appellation node should not be used to record such information and should remain empty.|

R. R. Tolkien), formal languages (e.g. binary, mathematics, etc.), or symbolic languages (e.g. emojis), for example, an artist that would use @ID as their name. The choice of documenting non-natural languages depends on the vocabulary used by an institution, although it goes against the scope of the class `E56_Language`.|

|**Typical Case·s**|In Artists in Canada, the identifier (Actor ID Type) of Yousuf Karsh (Actor Appellation) is 8494 (Actor ID). Yousuf Karsh is the English spelling (Actor Appellation Language) of the Armenian-Canadian photographer’s full name (Actor Appellation Type), whereas Յուսուֆ Քարշ (Actor Appellation) is the Armenian spelling (Actor Appellation Language). Yousuf Karsh is his preferred name (Actor Appellation Precedence) by the National Gallery of Canada. Yousuf (Actor Appellation Part) is his first name (Actor Appellation Part Type) and Karsh (Actor Appellation Part) is his surname (Actor Appellation Part Type).

For example, the Tate might indicate in its records that *A View from an Apartment* (2004-2005) is by Jeff Wall (Actor Appellation) and that *Diagonal Composition* (1993) is by Jeffrey Wall (Actor Appellation), thus creating two actor appellations for a single artist. In this case, a preferred actor appellation should be specified (e.g. Actor Appellation Precedence should be indicated as "Preferred" for Jeff Wall so that Jeffrey Wall will automatically be inferred as "Non-Preferred").|
|**Edge Case·s**|A provider might have more than two actor appellations for a single actor and might not wish to only identify its preferred appellation, but to rank both of them. For example, Actor Appellation Precedence indicated as "1" (preferred) for Jeff Wall, as "2" (non-preferred to 1 but preferred to 3) for Jeffrey Wall, and as "3" (non-preferred) for J. Wall. The model accommodates binary precedence rather than rankings. This means that no precedence should be determined based on language, such as in the case of bilingual organizational names that officially hold equivalent value. For example, the National Gallery of Canada or Musée des beaux-arts du Canada would likely not want to ascribe a precedence to either of its appellations, but it might want to ascribe precedence to both of these appellations over NGC, National Gallery, MBAC, or Musée des beaux-arts. Only two appellations (one in English and one in French) with no precedence will be ascribed in this case. This example shows that any more than two appellations poses the problem of precedence and does not indicate how the data should, ultimately, be displayed (e.g. English before French or vice-versa).|

|**Typical Case·s**|In Artists in Canada, the identifier (Actor ID Type) of Yousuf Karsh (Actor Appellation) is 8494 (Actor ID).

Its International Securities Identification Number is CA7392391016 (Actor ID; Actor ID Type "ISIN") and it is traded as TSX: POW, which could have its dedicated actor appellations as well (Actor Appellation Type "Stock Symbol") (Wikipedia 2022b; Wikimedia 2022).<br><br>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson wrote *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* under his pen name Lewis Carroll while continuing to publish work as a mathematician under his birth name.

|**Edge Case·s**|A translated Actor Appellation, such as "Léonard de Vinci", can be considered to be an Actor Appellation in its own right with the Actor Appellation Type "Name", but it could also be considered an Actor Appellation Type "Exonym" because this Actor Appellation is only used in the French Language. This begs the question of whether there can be more than one Actor Appellation Type for a single Actor Appellation (e.g. "Exonym" and "Name") and how the providing institution represents this when contributing its data.|

|**Comment·s**|This field qualifies the Actor Appellation and relates to an Actor Appellation so that there cannot be an Actor Appellation Type without an Actor Appellation.<br><br>It is difficult to determine the limits of an appellation (e.g. is the birth name of a married woman a distinct Actor Appellation?) so that the content of this field will heavily rely on what the provider of the data considers to be an Actor Appellation. For example, Anne of Green Gables’ birth name would be Anne Shirley, and she became Anne Blythe by marrying Gilbert Blythe. A museum might enter Anne Shirley as her Actor Appellation, and another might consider Anne Shirley Blythe as her Actor Appellation, with Anne being the first name, Shirley the maiden name, and Blythe the married name. Once again, the institution’s authority would be respected here.<br><br>For marginalized communities where individuals have often been ascribed names that they do not consider their own, it seems preferable to link the actor (`E39_Actor`) to the name use activity (`F52_Name_Use_Activity`) to indicate that the name is imposed on the person. Some imposed names could be accounted for here (such as when the Actor Appellation is a slave name), but there is no way to account for the correct name nor to give precedence to the person’s preferred name because CHIN is non-authoritative. For example, "Malcolm Little" could be typified as a slave name and "Malcolm X" as a given name.|

|**Edge Case·s**|When it comes to actor appellations that are mostly attributable to relationships (such as nicknames), the Actor Appellation Use Date Begin depends on when the related actor started using the Actor Appellation.

|**Edge Case·s**|The interpretation of the "Before" and "After" qualifiers can serve to determine the exact boundaries of the time-span of an event. For example, if an event was said to occur before 1950, it would be possible to deduce its time-span to be between the birth of its participant and the year 1950, given that the birth dates are certain. Ideally, whenever the semantics of date qualifiers allow the inference of a time-span with certainty, it would be better to use a time-span with the Date Begin and Date End nodes and not to add statements with the literal qualifiers. However, such reasoning would require caution during the mapping process as a data provider can also have internal data entry rules concerning the assignment of such qualifiers, but it might not be included with the data itself, thus causing misinterpretation.|

|**Edge Case·s**|SAMO is a graffiti tag that was used in New York from 1977 to 1980, primarily by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Al Diaz. It could be considered an Actor Appellation (Actor Appellation Type "Pseudonym"); if so, the dates would not be problematic (Actor Appellation Use Date End "1980-12-31T23:59:59"). However, it could also be considered an artefact (as SAMO was graffitied across the city), thus possibly used by multiple actors (Artefact Appellation) (Wikipedia 2021a). This begs the question of whether an appellation use date has an end when people continue to use the appellation well after the actor’s death.

|**Typical Case·s**|In Artists in Canada, the identifier (Actor ID Type) of Yousuf Karsh (Actor Appellation) is 8494 (Actor ID). Yousuf Karsh is the English spelling (Actor Appellation Language) of the Armenian-Canadian photographer’s full name (Actor Appellation Type), whereas Յուսուֆ Քարշ (Actor Appellation) is the Armenian spelling (Actor Appellation Language). Yousuf Karsh is his preferred name (Actor Appellation Precedence) by the National Gallery of Canada. Yousuf (Actor Appellation Part) is his first name (Actor Appellation Part Type) and Karsh (Actor Appellation Part) is his surname (Actor Appellation Part Type). Karsh used his full name all his professional life (Actor Appellation Use Context), which spans from 1932 (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin Qualifier) to 1992 (Actor Appellation Use Date End) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date End Qualifier) (Canadian Heritage, Government of Canada 2011).<br><br>Charles Lutwidge Dodgson wrote *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* under his pen name Lewis Carroll while continuing to publish work as a mathematician under his birth name. He would thus have two actor appellations: Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Actor Appellation Type "Birth Name", Actor Appellation Use Context "Customary Name") and Lewis Carroll (Actor Appellation Type "Pen Name", Actor Appellation Use Context "Children’s Book Writing"). He published under his pen name Lewis Carroll for the first time in March 1856 (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date Begin Qualifier) when his poem *Solitude* appeared in *The Train*, and for the last time in February 1898 (Actor Appellation Use Date End) CE (Actor Appellation Use Date End Qualifier) when his book *Three Sunsets and Other Poems* was published (Wikipedia 2022a).|
|**Edge Case·s**|The interpretation of the "Before" and "After" qualifiers can serve to determine the exact boundaries of the time-span of an event. For example, if an event was said to occur before 1950, it would be possible to deduce its time-span to be between the birth of its participant and the year 1950, given that the birth dates are certain. Ideally, whenever the semantics of date qualifiers allow the inference of a time-span with certainty, it would be better to use a time-span with the Date Begin and Date End nodes and not to add statements with the literal qualifiers. However, such reasoning would require caution during the mapping process as a data provider can also have internal data entry rules concerning the assignment of such qualifiers, but it might not be included with the data itself, thus causing misinterpretation.|

|**Comment·s**|There can be more than one qualifier at once for a single Date End (e.g. "BCE" and "BC" which is the same information, the former being qualified using the non-Christian acronym "Before Common Era" and the latter using the Christian acronym "Before Christ").<br><br>Some important dates in history have alternative names that could be considered as appellations of more general periods, such as 9/11, Victory in Europe Day, D-Day, etc. These appellations are not currently managed in the model and should be treated following the [Messy Data](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/messy-data) pattern.<br><br>The use of certain qualifiers like "Before" and "After" are allowed, but if possible, CHIN recommends the use of only the entry nodes Date Begin and Date End. For example, if an event took place before 1945, it would be possible to indicate the value "1944-12-31T23:59:59" for the Date End entry node of this event.|

Recent scholarship has established the sitter’s name as "Madeleine", although her last name remains unknown. An annotation indicating "former title displaying insensitive racial language" could be placed on its appellations, with the former title being indicated as a non-preferred appellation (Artefact Appellation Precedence "Non-Preferred"), but a Curatorial Note Content ("Sitter in *Portrait of Madeleine,* former title displaying insensitive racial language with the sitter identified as being named "Madeleine" by Viktoria Schmidt-Linsenhoff") might also be used on the actor "Madeleine" who is depicted. The same Curatorial Note Content could also be applied to Marie-Guillemine Benoist. Whether the Curatorial Note Content is related to the artist, the person depicted or both depends on the provider's wording (Schmidt-Linsenhoff 2013; Waller 2018).|

For example, the Tom Thomson Memorial Art Gallery records Don Phillips’ *Triptych* as three objects:<br><br>- Artefact Appellation: *Triptych (1978) (left panel)*<br>Artefact ID: 994.039.1<br>Artefact ID Type: TTMAG\_ID<br>- Artefact Appellation: *Triptych (1978) (centre panel)*<br>Artefact ID: 994.039.2<br>Artefact ID Type: TTMAG\_ID<br>- Artefact Appellation: *Triptych (1978) (right panel)*<br>Artefact ID: 994.039.3<br>Artefact ID Type: TTMAG\_ID<br><br>On the other hand, the Vancouver Art Gallery records B.C. Binning’s *Mariner’s Triptych: For Night Navigation* as a single object:<br><br>Artefact Appellation: *Mariner’s Triptych: For Night Navigation*<br>  Artefact ID: 65.11<br>Artefact ID Type: VAG\_ID<br><br>Such cases indicate how multi-parts objects might be problematic to record both in terms of IDs, but also in the case of other fields such as appellations. For the moment, the ID becomes the bearer of the federation of the objects, which CHIN might not have intended and might have to address in the Artefact ID Type as well.|

|**Edge Case·s**|The interpretation of the "Before" and "After" qualifiers can serve to determine the exact boundaries of the time-span of an event. For example, if an event was said to occur before 1950, it would be possible to deduce its time-span to be between the birth of its participant and the year 1950, given that the birth dates are certain. Ideally, whenever the semantics of date qualifiers allow the inference of a time-span with certainty, it would be better to use a time-span with the Date Begin and Date End nodes and not to add statements with the literal qualifiers. However, such reasoning would require caution during the mapping process as a data provider can also have internal data entry rules concerning the assignment of such qualifiers, but it might not be included with the data itself, thus causing misinterpretation.|

|**Comment·s**|There can be more than one qualifier at once for a single Date Begin (e.g. "BCE" and "BC" which is the same information, the former being qualified using the non-Christian acronym "Before Common Era" and the latter using the Christian acronym "Before Christ").<br><br>Some important dates in history have alternative names that could be considered as appellations of more general periods, such as 9/11, Victory in Europe Day, D-Day, etc. These appellations are not currently managed in the model and should be treated following the [Messy Data](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/messy-data) pattern.<br><br>The use of certain qualifiers like "Before" and "After" are allowed, but if possible, CHIN recommends the use of only the entry nodes Date Begin and Date End. For example, if an event took place before 1945, it would be possible to indicate the value "1944-12-31T23:59:59" for the Date End entry node of this event. In this scenario, the Date Begin entry node would remain empty.|

|**Edge Case·s**|The interpretation of the "Before" and "After" qualifiers can serve to determine the exact boundaries of the time-span of an event. For example, if an event was said to occur before 1950, it would be possible to deduce its time-span to be between the birth of its participant and the year 1950, given that the birth dates are certain. Ideally, whenever the semantics of date qualifiers allow the inference of a time-span with certainty, it would be better to use a time-span with the Date Begin and Date End nodes and not to add statements with the literal qualifiers. However, such reasoning would require caution during the mapping process as a data provider can also have internal data entry rules concerning the assignment of such qualifiers, but it might not be included with the data itself, thus causing misinterpretation.|

|**Potential Error·s**|TBD|
|**Comment·s**|There can be more than one qualifier at once for a single Date End (e.g. "BCE" and "BC" which is the same information, the former being qualified using the non-Christian acronym "Before Common Era" and the latter using the Christian acronym "Before Christ").<br><br>Some important dates in history have alternative names that could be considered as appellations of more general periods, such as 9/11, Victory in Europe Day, D-Day, etc. These appellations are not currently managed in the model and should be treated following the [Messy Data pattern](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/messy-data).<br><br>The use of certain qualifiers like "Before" and "After" are allowed, but if possible, CHIN recommends the use of only the entry nodes Date Begin and Date End. For example, if an event took place before 1945, it would be possible to indicate the value "1944-12-31T23:59:59" for the Date End entry node of this event.|

|**Edge Case·s**|Maud Kathleen Lewis was born in her South Ohio, NS (Birth Place) childhood home to John Dowley (Father Appellation) and Agnes Dowley (Mother Appellation) (Art Gallery of Nova Scotia n.d.). In addition to documenting the municipality where she was born, an institution might want to record that "she was born in her childhood home". The latter could be considered a Curatorial Note about Maud Kathleen Lewis. The same would apply to the death of a person happening in their childhood home.<br><br>The Unknown Soldier (Actor Appellation) died in France as a soldier during the First World War. Their death occurred between the 3rd of October, 1914 (when the first Canadian contingent sailed for Europe) and the 11th of November, 1918 (when Canadians’ direct involvement in the fight ended), though the war ended officially with the Treaty of Versailles on the 28th of June, 1919. They were buried at the Cabaret-Rouge War Cemetery near Vimy (France) before their remains were moved in a commemorative sarcophagus in Ottawa (ON, Canada). In the DOPHEDA model, their move from their place of death to their burial place would not represent their passage in Cabaret-Rouge and only indicate a move from France (where they died between 1914 and 1918) to Canada in 2000 (Foot 2018).<br><br>Ramses II died around 1213 BCE according to Egyptian chronology (Hornung et al. 2006, 476-478). His body was embalmed and deposited in tomb KV7 in the Valley of Kings (modern-day Egypt), but was soon moved and transferred into other tombs by Egyptian priests to protect it from looting. The body was finally uncovered in tomb TT320 in 1881 (Wikipedia 2021d). In this example, the mummy transferred, or at least discovered by archæologists, should not be considered a person (`E21_Person`) but rather a biological object (`E20_Biological_Object`) which can be moved. At the moment, this kind of transformation cannot be documented with this entry node.|

|**Edge Case·s**|The interpretation of the "Before" and "After" qualifiers can serve to determine the exact boundaries of the time-span of an event. For example, if an event was said to occur before 1950, it would be possible to deduce its time-span to be between the birth of its participant and the year 1950, given that the birth dates are certain. Ideally, whenever the semantics of date qualifiers allow the inference of a time-span with certainty, it would be better to use a time-span with the Date Begin and Date End nodes and not to add statements with the literal qualifiers. However, such reasoning would require caution during the mapping process as a data provider can also have internal data entry rules concerning the assignment of such qualifiers, but it might not be included with the data itself, thus causing misinterpretation.|

|**Typical Case·s**|Tom Thomson’s artistic peak is considered to have occurred in Canada (Flourishing Place) and have run from March 1916 (Flourishing Date Begin) CE (Flourishing Date Begin Qualifier) until his death on July 8, 1917 (Flourishing Date End) CE (Flourishing Date End Qualifier). During this period, Thomson mostly painted the Ontario landscape as he travelled across the province (Silcox 2015, 16).<br><br>Cyril Henry Barraud, an English painter who participated in World War I as a war artist for the Canadian army, is considered by Artists in Canada to have flourished between 1913 (Flourishing Date Begin) and 1915 (Flourishing Date End) CE (Flourishing Date Begin Qualifier; Flourishing Date End Qualifier) in Ontario, Canada (Flourishing Place) (Canadian Heritage, Government of Canada 2021).<br><br>Yousuf Karsh is considered to have been one of the most important photographers during the peak of photojournalism in the 1940s (Flourishing Date Begin "1940-01-01T00:00:00") and 1950s (Flourishing Date End "1959-12-31T23:59:59"), working with such magazines as *Life* (Allen 2014).|
|**Edge Case·s**|There are three main cases where there could be more than a single flourishing for an artist: flourishing in different fields, in different mediums, and in a single field and medium interspersed by calmer periods of production.

Jean Paul Riopelle’s sculptural flourishing would be considered different from his painting flourishing. Finally, an artist could have more than one important flourishing in a single domain with a long period of inactivity in between. For example, Harper Lee was widely recognized as an accomplished author after the publication of *To Kill a Mockingbird*, but published very little for a long period of time before writing its sequel *Go Set a Watchman* (Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica 2021). This could either be considered to be a long period of flourishing spanning the majority of her career as a writer, or two related flourishing periods apart.<br><br>Numerical entering of dates might be misleading.

|**Edge Case·s**|A group might not have a single Formation Place as its members can consider themselves part of a collective without sharing a common space.<br><br>When an event takes place online or in a virtual universe, it could become difficult to determine its physical location. For example, an artist might found a purely online group from a computer in Winnipeg (MB, Canada) yet use a gathering platform accessible on a web server that could also be considered as the location of the formation of the group. The location of each member can similarly be problematic (e.g. each participating player’s physical location in an online game).<br><br>In 2008, Yousuf Karsh’s wife, Estrellita Karsh, endowed the Estrellita and Yousuf Karsh Assistant Curator of Photographs position at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MA, United States). The curators that endorsed that position formed a group by the name "Estrellita and Yousuf Karsh Assistant Curator of Photographs", which is also an occupation they have all held (using the Occupation pattern would be possible, but the group would never be "created"). The endowment is ongoing and, as such, the group remains active (Estate of Yousuf Karsh 2021). Yet, an important question remains: can the members of the group (i.e. the curators) act collectively (thus qualifying as a group) even if only one of them endorses the title at once? In this context, how to treat the group remains unclear.|

## Founding Actor Appellation

|**Scope**|This field designates the entire identifying word·s, number·s, symbol·s, or code·s by which an actor (person or group) mainly responsible for the forming of the group, though they might not be a member of the group, is distinguished from others, such as the name, title, or designation as it has been attributed by a contributing institution. Their appellation is an identifying agreed upon term that is descriptive or connotative.

|**Edge Case·s**|If a war artist was assigned the number M32 435 C84 (his military registration number), this number would qualify as an Actor Appellation and the Actor Appellation Type would be "Military Registration Number" or "Military ID".

|**Edge Case·s**|The recipient of an award might be considered as part of a group that includes all of the recipients of this specific award, although it is not a formal group. In such a case, the founder of the group might be considered to be the first recipient just as much as the granting organism. For example, the Governor General's Literary Awards were conceived and inaugurated in 1937 by John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir who was then acting as 15th Governor General of Canada. He awarded the award for Fiction to Laura G. Salverson for *The Dark Weaver*, for Poetry of drama to E. J. Pratt for *The Fable of the Goats*, and for Non-fiction to Stephen Leacock for *My Discovery of the West* (Canada Council for the Arts n.d.). Considering the group would be the "Recipients of the Governor General of Canada Literary Awards", the original founder·s could either be solely John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, or the first recipients, arguing they played a concrete role in the foundation of the group.|

In the case of such mergers and acquisitions, what would be considered to be the leaving of a group and the joining of another, when the dissolution of the company itself is up for debate, would be unclear.<br><br>The interpretation of the "Before" and "After" qualifiers can serve to determine the exact boundaries of the time-span of an event. For example, if an event was said to occur before 1950, it would be possible to deduce its time-span to be between the birth of its participant and the year 1950, given that the birth dates are certain. Ideally, whenever the semantics of date qualifiers allow the inference of a time-span with certainty, it would be better to use a time-span with the Date Begin and Date End nodes and not to add statements with the literal qualifiers. However, such reasoning would require caution during the mapping process as a data provider can also have internal data entry rules concerning the assignment of such qualifiers, but it might not be included with the data itself, thus causing misinterpretation.|

|**Comment·s**|There can be more than one qualifier at once for a single Date End (e.g. "BCE" and "BC" which is the same information, the former being qualified using the non-Christian acronym "Before Common Era" and the latter using the Christian acronym "Before Christ").<br><br>Some important dates in history have alternative names that could be considered as appellations of more general periods, such as 9/11, Victory in Europe Day, D-Day, etc. These appellations are not currently managed in the model and should be treated following the [Messy Data](/collections-model/en/target-model/current/messy-data) pattern.<br><br>The use of certain qualifiers like "Before" and "After" are allowed, but if possible, CHIN recommends the use of only the entry nodes Date Begin and Date End. For example, if an event took place before 1945, it would be possible to indicate the value "1944-12-31T23:59:59" for the Date End entry node of this event.|

## Group Member Role

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field indicates the parts, activities, functions, and duties endorsed by the actor with regards to a related group with which they have dealings ranging in duration from brief to enduring. These reflect a set of connected behaviours, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms expected from both parties and reflected in the contacts between them. They also reflect the way they behave towards each other, as well as being based on the function of the group and/or the mutual interest between its members.|

|**Edge Case·s**|The recipient of an award might be considered as part of a group that includes all of the recipients of this specific award, although it is not a formal group. In such a case, the founder of the group might be considered to be the first recipient just as much as the granting organism. For example, the Governor General's Literary Awards were conceived and inaugurated in 1937 by John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir who was then acting as 15th Governor General of Canada. He awarded the award for Fiction to Laura G. Salverson for *The Dark Weaver*, for Poetry of drama to E.J. Pratt for *The Fable of the Goats*, and for Non-fiction to Stephen Leacock for *My Discovery of the West* (Canada Council for the Arts n.d.). Considering the group would be the "Recipients of the Governor General of Canada Literary Awards", the original founder·s could either be solely John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, or the first recipients, arguing they played a concrete role in the foundation of the group.<br><br>It could be argued that a person’s role within a family could remain the same no matter the current members of the family. For instance, an adopted child could be documented as bearing the role "Adopted" with the whole family group. In such a case, it would imply the use of the Group belonging pattern and the addition of the family type to the group.|

|**Edge Case·s**|In 2016, Anish Kapoor coated his 2006 sculpture *Cloud Gate* in Vantablack, a light-absorbing material to which he bought the exclusive rights in terms of artistic use. The material has been developed and patented by Surrey NanoSystems (Higgins 2022). In this case, Vantablack could be considered to be a material (part of the sculpture) or a mark (as it was added to the sculpture years after it was first unveiled to the public) that amounts to a signature considering the use of Vantablack is exclusive to Kapoor. It is also debatable whether this Mark Type would apply to Surrey NanoSystems as well. This also poses the question of whether, if a mark is mainly used to enforce identity, it must enforce the identity of the actor of interest (associated Actor Appellation) or if it can enforce that of a third party (e.g. even though *Cloud Gate* is by Kapoor, this could be considered to enforce Surrey NanoSystems’ identity just as much).<br><br>What constitutes a mark might also be complicated by what it is posed on. For example, a sunburn such as that in Dennis Oppenheim’s *Reading Position for Second Degree Burn* (showing two parallel images of a man sunbathing on the sand where the first one shows an open book facing down on his chest and the second one displays the sunburn mark of the book upon removal) could be considered a mark of type "Sunburn" (Oppenheim 1970).|

|**Typical Case·s**|*Canadissimo* (Artefact Appellation) was made by art collective BGL and presented at the Canada Pavilion of the Venice Biennale (Production Place) in 2015 (Production Date Begin; Production Date Begin Qualifier "or before"; Production Date End; Production Date End Qualifier "or before"). BGL is comprised of Jasmin Bilodeau (Production Actor Role "Creator"; Production Actor Priority "1"), Sébastien Giguère (Production Actor Role "Creator"; Production Actor Priority "1"), and Nicolas Laverdière (Production Actor Role "Creator"; Production Actor Priority "1") (Wikipedia 2022d).<br><br>*Self-Portrait* (Artefact Appellation) was taken in Ottawa (ON, Canada) (Production Place) in 1938 (Production Date Begin; Production Date End) by Yousuf Karsh (Production Actor Role "Creator") who was its sole creator (Production Actor Priority "1") (Karsh 1938).|
|**Edge Case·s**|In the case above, it could be argued that the Venice Biennale is the exhibition place rather than the production place, or both considering it is an installation.<br><br>When an event takes place online or in a virtual universe, it could become difficult to determine its physical location. For example, an artist might produce a purely online work from a computer in Winnipeg (MB, Canada) yet use a gathering platform accessible on a web server that could also be considered as the location of the production.|

|**Typical Case·s**|*Who Do You Think You Are?* by Alice Munro is held at Library and Archives Canada (Reference Document Institution Appellation), located at 395 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0N4 - Wellington General Collection (Reference Document Place) under the call number PS8576 U57 W46 1979 (Reference Document Call Number) (Library and Archives Canada 2022).|
|**Edge Case·s**|The Reference Document Call Number refers to the document’s identifier which in turn determines its location within an institution. However, an archival institution might have multiple physical addresses or branches. The building where the reference document is held currently has no assigned documentation field so that it could be documented under the Reference Document Call Number (e.g. "PS8576 U57 W46 1979 - Wellington General Collection") or under Reference Document Place (e.g. "395 Wellington St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0N4 - Wellington General Collection"), or even in the Reference Document Institution Appellation (e.g. "Library and Archives Canada - Wellington General").<br><br>When an event takes place online or in a virtual universe, it could become difficult to determine its physical location. Is it better to consider the initial physical location where actors of the event are? For example, the production of a digital work was carried out by an artist on a computer in Winnipeg (MB, Canada) even if the tool used is accessible on a web server. When the actors are in different places, is it better to name all the places where they are in order to define the location of the event? For example, should an event taking place in the Second Life game require identification of each participating player’s physical location, which might be difficult to pinpoint due to privacy and security reasons? Otherwise, is it better to use the location of the server that supports the said event? For example, an international meeting taking place on Zoom could only be in Amsterdam since some of the company's servers are located there.|

|**Typical Case·s**|Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded an honorary Canadian citizenship (Social Status Type) in 2007 (Social Status Date Begin) CE (Social Status Date Begin Qualifier) by the Parliament of Canada (Social Status Ascribing Actor Appellation). The honour was revoked by the House of Commons on September 27, 2018 and by the Senate (Social Status Place "Canada") on October 2, 2018 (Social Status Date End (debatable); Social Status Date End Qualifier "Before" (debatable)) due to human rights concerns over her treatment of the Rohingya (Wikipedia 2022i).<br><br>In 1990 (Social Status Date Begin) CE (Social Status Date Begin Qualifier), Yousuf Karsh was awarded the Companion of the Order of Canada (Social Status Type) by Queen Elizabeth II (Social Status Ascribing Actor Appellation) in Ottawa, CA-ON (Social Status Place). The social status was maintained even after Yousuf Karsh’s death in 2002 (Hillmer 2018; Skidmore 2015).|
|**Edge Case·s**|Yousuf Karsh’s social status as Companion of the Order of Canada can also be considered as a membership (Group Belonging entry nodes).<br><br>If a war artist was assigned the number M32 435 C84 (his military registration number), this number would qualify as an Actor Appellation and the Actor Appellation Type would be "Military Registration Number" or "Military ID". If the War Museum is related to the Department of National Defence or uses these numbers to identify artists, this number would qualify both as an Actor Appellation (the number assigned by the Department of Defence) and as an Actor ID (the same number used by the War Museum).<br><br>The French appellation of Power Corporation of Canada is Power Corporation du Canada. An institution wanting to record both these appellations could either create two Actor Appellations (one for Power Corporation of Canada indicated as English in the Actor Appellation Language node, and one for Power Corporation du Canada indicated as French in the Actor Appellation Language node) or a single, bilingual one (Power Corporation of Canada/Power Corporation du Canada).<br><br>The same applies to many governmental bodies in Canada such as PCH Canadian Heritage/Patrimoine canadien where, in addition, the question of the language of the acronym is unclear: if PCH is the Actor Appellation with an Actor Appellation Type labelled "Acronym", it is possible to consider this as a single, bilingual appellation.<br><br>Some institutions need to document animals as actors and although the current definition could accommodate this, CIDOC CRM might not.

## Social Status Type

|---|---|
|**Scope**|This field indicates the relative rank and possible honour or prestige an actor holds relative to how well they are perceived to match society’s goals and ideals, as well as their associated hierarchical position in the group’s social stratification. Status reflects a set of connected behaviours, activities, functions, rights, obligations, duties, beliefs, lifestyle, and norms. It relies on the interactions between said actor and a community whose conference of the status upon the actor is a determining factor in the latter having tasks, rights, and beliefs associated with said status.|

|**Comment·s**|Defining a social status type requires identifying the generalizable characteristics and symbols applicable to all who have that status. These characteristics must be contingent, relational, and dynamic in the sense that what they entail might change over time, but they must nonetheless remain salient.<br><br>A single actor can carry multiple different statuses at one time, just like they can carry a single status multiples times simultaneously. An actor’s status tends to vary with social context: in certain societies, lineage is the main determinant of status whilst in others professional occupations are more predominant.|

For example, an artist might have been granted a sustained presence on an online platform as a guest contributor where they created dedicated works, and the geographical location from which they created them can be a Stay Place just as much as that of the web server that hosts the site.|

|**Typical Case·s**|In Artists in Canada, the main technique associated with Yousuf Karsh is photography (Technique Used Type).|
|**Edge Case·s**|Yousuf Karsh was known in particular for his portraits. Depending on the classification chosen, a vocabulary could define portrait photography as a technique, like the AAT with "commercial portraiture" (AAT 2019), or simply stop at "photography" without any child terms. The latter implies that producing a portrait does not require different skills than producing any type of photograph. In this case, further specification of the techniques can be achieved through the description of artefacts. The information concerning the portrait could then be managed via the subjects of the photograph produced by Yousuf Karsh or the description of its composition.|

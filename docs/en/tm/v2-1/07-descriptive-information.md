description: The Actors Target Model is intended to model the Actors facet of CHIN‚Äôs DOPHEDA (that will cover collections data more broadly). Patterns most relevant to actors' lives are presented along with diagrams and examples illustrating them, as well as a record and explanation of relevant decisions that were made when developing said patterns. The current document is a work in progress and, as such, will be enhanced periodically. Elements currently under development or review are listed as issues.

## Biography

CIDOC CRM dictates that textual information, such as the biography of an actor written by an expert, should be rendered with the class `E33_Linguistic_Object` linked to the `E39_Actor` through a `P67_refers_to` property, thus indicating that the biography refers to the actor. As seen in the section on [Literal Content](/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/general-concepts#literal-content), the content of the biography is then documented in a string of text linked to the `E33_Linguistic_Object` through the property `P190_has_symbolic_content`.

Still, the author of a biography most often relies on other sources of information when researching and recounting the life of the actor; such information and its sources should thus also be documented. The simplest and most semantically correct way to render such a citation is to use the [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) property `dct:source` to quote the bibliographic citation as a string of text.

| üí°  Example: <br/><br/>Jean Paul Riopelle's biography on Wikipedia (the contributor documented in the Named Graph) is the following: "Jean-Paul Riopelle, CC GOQ (7 October 1923‚Äì12 March 2002) was a painter and sculptor from Quebec, Canada. He became the first Canadian painter (since James Wilson Morrice) to attain widespread international recognition." <br/><br/>The source of this information is the following: "Tate, London, Artist Biography http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/jean-paul-riopelle-1847". |

## Visual Item

Actors are often depicted in visual elements (painting, photographies, etc.) and it is important to link those images to actors, not only to give a visual representation of them but also to identify people and groups represented in such works.

CIDOC CRM distinguishes visual representations (`E36_Visual_Item`) both from the physical objects carrying such representations (`E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing`) and from digital representations of such images (`D1_Digital_Object`). The links between these three image concepts is depicted in the following diagram.

<iframe frameborder="0" style="width:100%;height:400px;" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/?target=blank&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=063_Pattern_VisualItemDigitalObject_p.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1Pk2bUZK8D12yLEmCSRBxQJz-tqWkR-4S%26export%3Ddownload"></iframe>


If the physical support of the image (`E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing`) can be directly linked to the `E39_Actor` through the `P62_depicts` property, the *digital* image (`D1_Digital_Object`) cannot be linked to the actor.  Considering how this project will mostly manage digital images, a more precise pattern accounting for the fact that there might be several supports of a single `E36_Visual_Item` is warranted. 

Visual items are, as the scope note of the CIDOC CRM class states, "intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks and images" [(Le Boeuf et al. 2015, sec. E36 Visual Item)](/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/bibliography#le-boeuf-et-al-2015). They are independent of the orientation, size, color or other characteristic that does not affect their identification. For example, a black and white copy of the *Mona Lisa* would still be considered to carry the `E36_Visual_Item` of the *Mona Lisa*. A more challenging (edge) case, however, pertains to the alteration of an image that remains recognizable, but *could* be considered as a *new item* (e.g. Andy Warhol's *Marilyn Diptych*, which uses a photography of Marilyn Monroe and "recolours" it can be considered as a new artwork, and therefore as a new visual item). In some cases, a visual item could be (sub)divided into multiple ones, especially if an image contains other items, as in the case of Giovanni Paolo Panini‚Äôs *Modern Rome*. In any case, it is possible to link multiple instances of `E36_Visual_Item` together with the property `P165_incorporates`.  This pattern enables the record of the incorporation of one visual item in another one (e.g. Warhol‚Äôs *Marilyn Diptych* painting incorporates an original Marilyn Monroe photography; Panini‚Äôs *Modern Rome* incorporates several famous artworks such as Michelangelo's *Moses* and Gian Lorenzo Bernini's statues of *Constantine*, *David*, *Apollo and Daphne*).

In addition to precisely identifying visual items and their physical support, it is necessary to distinguish their digital renderings in the form of an image and a URL that must be refered to independently from the `D1_Digital_Object` URI. The URL of the digital image is thus assigned an  `E42_Identifier`.

In addition, other visual elements can be relevant to an actor's life and production, such as signatures, companies‚Äô logos, etc. These can be represented using the `E37_Mark` class connected to an `E39_Actor` following the same pattern as that of the `E36_Visual_Item`. However, this requires the use of the `PC138_Represents` property-class to specify (with a `P138.1_mode_of_representation` property) that the `E37_Mark` represents the actor symbolically.

## Curatorial Note

Most museums have a ‚Äúremark‚Äù or "notes" field linked to the actors and objects  they document in order to account for non-formatted text that is distinct from descriptive texts intended to be published (such as captions for example, which will be modelled later on as part of the Objects facet of this project). In order to model this kind of information, the `E33_Linguistic_Object` class must be used along with a `E55_Type` ‚ÄúCuratorial Note‚Äù. This `E33_Linguistic_Object` can then be linked to the actor it is commenting on with the property `P67_refers_to`. By default, the creator of the curatorial note is considered to be the institution or person providing the data (as stated in the named graph), but if a curator or expert was an explicit author/creator, it would be possible to add a creation event that could then be linked to the creator of that curatorial note.

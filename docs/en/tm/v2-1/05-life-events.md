description: The Actors Target Model is intended to model the Actors facet of CHIN‚Äôs DOPHEDA (that will cover collections data more broadly). Patterns most relevant to actors' lives are presented along with diagrams and examples illustrating them, as well as a record and explanation of relevant decisions that were made when developing said patterns. The current document is a work in progress and, as such, will be enhanced periodically. Elements currently under development or review are listed as issues.

## Technique Used

The production of artefacts is currently minimally documented ([see section below](/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/artefacts#artefact-creation-and-the-role-of-the-actor-in-the-creation)) an will be expanded significantly with the development of the Objects fact of this project. It currently focuses on the creation of objects by actors, including the role they play in this creation. The technique they used is one of the important elements to document even at this embryonic stage. 

Because providers often document the techniques used by an actor by linking this information to this *actor* instead of linking it to the production of (an) *artefact(s)*, the data model should account for this structure: an `E55_Type` specifying the technique, linked directly to the actor with the property `P2_has_type`, appears to be the best pattern in this situation.

| üîé  *To Be Discussed* <br/> <br/> CHIN is aware that this pattern is not ideal as it implies that an <code>E39_Actor</code> is a Technique. When this pattern was developed, there was no other way of representing the use of a technique by a creator in CIDOC CRM. However, two alternatives are currently being developed and could be leveraged at a later date: <a href="https://github.com/linked-art/linked.art/issues/237#issuecomment-611035443">Linked.Art‚Äôs  E13_Attribute_Assignment relationship strategy</a> or <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmsoc/sites/default/files/CRMsoc_20190326.pdf">CRMsoc‚Äôs Phase class</a>. |

| üí°  Example: <br/><br/> In the case of Jean Paul Riopelle, the artist used the technique "drawing" and "painting". |

## Occupation

There is a difference between the technique used by an actor in the context of creating an artefact, and an occupation this actor associates with or is associated with more formally. For example, an actor A could be a *painter*, and use the technique *watercolor* but also have used once the technique *sculpture*, without being a considered a sculptor or considering themselves to be. Some of the information pertaining to the specific role an actor plays in the creation of an artefact can be modelled directly as part of this production ([see section below](/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/artefacts#artefact-creation-and-the-role-of-the-actor-in-the-creation)). But a more broader occupation‚Äîthat remains untied to any *specific* artefact by an actor‚Äîwould differ from a particular production role and also has to be documented. 

There is also a difference between an occupation (e.g. musician), which can include long-held hobbies, and employment as an individual that is part of an `E74_Group` (e.g. an employed musician in an orchestra). Such employment is modelled following the group belonging pattern explained [below](/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/social-bonds#group-belonging).

In order to account for these intricacies, occupations are modelled with the class `F51_Pursuit` (from the CIDOC CRM extension of [FRBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records), [FRBRoo](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbroo/)) which is an event that is enacted by (`P14_carried_out_by`) the `E39_Actor` over a length of time. This `F51_Pursuit` is then typed with a qualifier stating what the occupation is (paintor, sculptor, artist, etc.).

When it comes to schooling occupations, the [Group Belonging pattern](https://chin-rcip.github.io/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/social-bonds#group-belonging) should be used rather than the occupation one when the information pertains to an individual being a *member* of a school rather than their schooling *activity*. Still, the occupation pattern could be used *if the input data is not referring to any institution in particular* (e.g., this person was a student from 1952 to 1964), although the [Social Status pattern](https://chin-rcip.github.io/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/life-events#social-status) could also be used.

## Social Status

Whilst actors have professional or artistic occupations, people also hold social status(es), like being a leader, an Indigenous Community Elder, or a knight. These cannot be modeled as occupations because they do not fit the specific scope of `F51_Pursuit` since they might be held without the individual having actively and intentionally pursued the status. 

The [CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model Social Extension (CRMsoc)](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmsoc/), once it is developed, will likely have a class akin to a ‚ÄúPhase‚Äù that could document such statuses, but it is still under development. In the meantime, the best way to model social statuses is to use an `E7_Activity` class carried out by the `E39_Actor` holding said status. 

When it comes to schooling activities, the [Group Belonging](https://chin-rcip.github.io/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/social-bonds#group-belonging) pattern is certainly the most common option as museums describe essentially the fact of being a member of a school rather than the schooling activity itself. However, the current pattern could be used if the input data is not referring to any institution in particular (e.g., this person was a student from 1952 to 1964). To describe the latter, we do not have a consensus whether this pattern or the  one should be used.

## Flourishing dates

The flourishing dates of a creator are often an important piece of information for heritage institutions. In terms of modelling, the flourishing period is technically not an `E7_Activity` since the `E39_Actor` is not actively carrying their flourishing; it is rather an arbitrary event determined by other people (usually experts such as historians or heritage professionals). For these reasons, it has been represented as an `E5_Event` rather than a `E7_Activity`.

The `E39_Actor` is a participant (modelled with the property `P11_has_participant`) of this `E5_Event` and this same event is designated as a flourishing event using an `E55_Type`. This event can of course be situated chronologically and geographically.

## Specific traits

Most of providers have unique fields documenting specific collections or objects. How to deal with such types of information has not yet been determined.

## Birth/Death of People and Formation/Dissolution of Groups

The Birth/Death and Formation/Dissolution patterns use the same modelling approach whereas an event embodies the "creation" and "ending" of an `E39_Actor` (per CIDOC CRM custom). With this pattern, it is possible to date and place each of these events.

When modelling the borth of a person, the use of an `E67_Birth` event enables the use of the `P96_by_mother` and `P97_from_father` properties to link the actor to their biological mother and father (instances of `E21_Person`). This pattern can only be used for the *biological* parents (because of the CIDOC CRM specification) so that other types of parenthood (adoptive, surrogate, etc.) must be rendered through [Relationship patterns] (/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/social-bonds#relationships). 

For more details on this, please see [Appendix F: Discussions, Birth/Death of People and Formation/Dissolution of Groups](/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/appendix-f-discussions#discussion-birthdeath-of-people-and-formationdissolution-of-groups).


| ![GitHub Mark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48293227/104475587-49182180-558d-11eb-87fc-9f95190cb332.png) *Related Github Issue*<br/><br/>This topic is discussed in [Issue #16](https://github.com/chin-rcip/chin-rcip/issues/16) |


When it comes to groups, the "birth" of a group, namely its formation, can be enacted by any `E39_Actor` carrying out an `E66_Formation` event (i.e. this actor does not *have* to be the *official* founder of the group) and an `E74_Group` (as a sub-class of `E39_Actor`) can create another `E74_Group`. Similarly, the dissolution of a group (`E67_Dissolution` event) can be the doing of another group. 

However, in the case of the death of a person, another challenge arises in terms of accounting for the location of the *remains* of the deceased (knowing that this is information that is often recorded, especially in the case of famous people). 

There are two ways to model such information: 

*   with an `E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing` instance representing the grave; 
*   through a move of the `E21_Person` instance to the location of their grave after their death.

The main challenge with creating an `E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing` as a representation of the grave is to link this `E24_Physical_Human-Made_Thing` instance with the `E21_Person` instance cannot be done simply. 

Representing the post-death move of the `E21_Person` to their grave through an `E9_Move` event is easier to model, but it is conceptually problematic as a dead person is technically no longer an `E21_Person` capable of carrying out activities such as moving. The logic of CIDOC CRM dictates the creation of a new `E20_Biological_Object` to replace the `E21_Person`. Technically, it would be necessary to create an `E5_Event` to represent the transformation of the `E21_Person` into an `E18_Physical_Thing` through an `E81_transformation` so that it is not induced that the person was buried alive. In the absence of a simple solution and because of the complexity and heaviness such a pattern would entail, CHIN has decided to compromise on semantic preciseness and to adopt a simpler model, assuming actors will be buried whilst dead: a `E9_Move` event has been chosen to represent the location of the grave, without creating a new `E20_Biological_Object` in place of the `E21_Person`. 

The [project linked.art](https://linked.art/model/actor/#birth-and-death-formation-and-dissolution) came to the same conclusion and stated that:

| ‚ÄúAfter death, people are still instances of Person which is a subclass of Actor, even though they can no longer carry out activities. People in comas or otherwise completely incapacitated also cannot carry out activities, but are not temporarily non-Actors. The modeling that death is a transformation from an instance of Person to an instance of Thing adds complexity for the sake of purity, but does not add any actual value. Thus a burial activity ([aat:300263485](http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/300263485)) buries a Person, not a Thing-that-used-to-be-a-Person. However if the skeleton is then dug up and exhibited, it is exhibited as a Thing. There is, therefore, a transition at some undetermined point.‚Äù |

The birth and death of an `E21_Person` is modelled per the following patterns:

## Moving events

Throughout their lives or activities, `E39_Actors` may travel, live or be present in various locations that are relevant to record. 

In CIDOC CRM, there is a distinction between the physical `E21_Person` that is located in space and can be subjected to `E9_Move` events, and the more abstract `E39_Actor` and `E74_Group` that *do not* move through space and time.

In order to record the locations of persons and groups, additional patterns are required:

1. An `E8_Acquisition` to record land or real estate properties acquired by groups;
2. An `E7_Activity` to indicate an `E21_Person` or `E74_Group` was/stayed in a location.

For more on this, please see [Appendix E: Moving Events](/collections-model/en/target-model/version-2-1/appendix-e-moving-events#) and [Github Issue #31](https://github.com/chin-rcip/collections-model/issues/31).

### Legal Headquarter Attribution

*This pattern will be reviewed*

Companies‚Äô legal and official headquarters must also be documented. This is something that could be done using an `E13_Attribute_Assignment` class (although this pattern is still under consideration and might change):

### `E7_Activity` Stay for `E21_Person` and `E74_Group`

In most cases, providers record the fact of *being somewhere* rather than that of *moving* so that it is more consistent with documenting practices to model this activity of being at a place instead of the event that a change of location entails. As such, an `E39_Actor`'s stay at a location is modelled using an `E7_Activity`, keeping in mind that stays include customary residences and are not limited to temporary stays such as vacations or travels.

The `E7_Activity` is thus situated geographically and temporally in addition to being typed as a ‚ÄúStay‚Äù (with an `E55_Type`).

## Influences

A creator might have been influenced by many things in their creative lives. These include people as well as other entities such as events or objects. However, CIDOC CRM traditionally represents influence through a relationship pattern articulated around associations between different instances of `E39_Actor`. To account for the richness of influences when it comes to creative endeavours, a different approach must be adopted as entities other than `E39_Actors` might influence a creator (events, styles, etc.). This issue is currently being discussed in the context of CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model Social Extension (CRMsoc) so that modelling of an influence pattern that goes beyond that of actors will be addressed at a later date. 

Even in the case of actors, the `P15_was_influenced_by` property, which has `E7_Activity` as a domain and any `E1_CRM_Entity` as a range, is not meant to render things that have an influence on people as it is intended to address influence on activities.

At the moment (version 2.1 of the TM), we do not have a pattern to render influences of non-actors on actors.

description: The Actors Target Model is intended to model the Actors facet of CHINâ€™s DOPHEDA (that will cover collections data more broadly). Patterns most relevant to actors' lives are presented along with diagrams and examples illustrating them, as well as a record and explanation of relevant decisions that were made when developing said patterns. The current document is a work in progress and, as such, will be enhanced periodically. Elements currently under development or review are listed as issues.

Certain data might be subject to legal rights, for example in the case of digital reproductions of art, of copyrighted documentation of artefacts, or of textual information such as biographies.

Rights management can be difficult to implement for an aggregator such as CHIN that does not claim authority over the contents its data model manages. CHIN has thus decided that, at least until the Objects Facet is launched in LOD, only rights-free and open data will be requested of providers. Therefore, at this stage, there is no need to assign specific rights statements to parts of the information provided by museums. Still, it will be possible to add a rights statement to the entire dataset in order to specify that the data is licensed under [Creative Commons Zero (Public Domain)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/). 


| ðŸ”Ž  *To Be Discussed* <br/><br/>CHIN is still trying to determine what would be the easiest and simplest way to handle rights in collaboration with providers. Is the open and copyright free limitation sufficient or is it too demanding of providers? What type of export would best suit the needs of institutions in the long term? |
